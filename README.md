# CraftingInterpreters
My progress going through [craftinginterpreters.com](http://craftinginterpreters.com)

This is just a place for me to document my progress implementing the Lox language from [Bob Nystrom's excellent Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The only work in here that's *actually mine* is the implementation of chapter challenges.
